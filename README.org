#+title: KIITOS/2

* No correlation to OS/2
This is the full rework of the original Kiitos from 2024, now with
an actually well-made codebase and easy-to-setup interrupts, at the
great cost of no longer having a bunch of ugly buggy nasm assembly, as well
as not actually having keyboard input or anything.

Good os anyways, Doom when

* Dependencies
** Minimal requirements
Do not use just that, please.
+ A C compiler for x86_64-unknown-none
+ An x86_64 assembler
** Probably needed for the barebones
+ clang/gcc
  + gcc will probably work for the forseeable future, however the officially-supported
    compiler is clang.
+ xorriso
+ git
  + Only required for the first ever ~make~, so as to clone and
    build the limine bootloader.
    The limine repo will not get deleted on ~make clean~-ing.
+ Some ~make~, either GNU or BSD
  + Yes, I bothered making it compatible. Yes, it looks ugly.
    If you ask me the GNU syntax is uglier.
** Recommended
+ clang
+ xorriso
+ git
+ bmake
+ qemu
+ gdb
